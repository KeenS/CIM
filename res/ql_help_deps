Usage:

	ql deps [--path <path>] <system>

Description:

Install dependencies of given system. If path is specified, install dependencies there.
Once you run 'ql --path <path> deps', you don't need to specify '--path' because the path is written out to '.quicklisp-path' in current directory.
You can run 'ql deps' for a local system if '.asd' file is in current directory.
This command is useful when you want to separate quicklisps for local project.

Example:

	ql deps --path ./quicklisp my-project
